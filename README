DESCRIPTION
===========

This is pup-volume-monitor, a lightweight drive and volume management backend. 

It works the same as gvfs volume monitor, except that it is quite small
and doesn't have any heavy dependencies like gnome-disk-utility or hal or dbus. 

It is this kind of software responsible for displaying drives in file managers
and file open/save dialogs in many linux distributions.

Originally developed by Akash Rawal for Puppy Linux (http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=78881)
it should work on any other Linux distrution due to its simplicity.


COMPILING & INSTALLING
======================

To generate configure, etc.. run:
	./setup-build-system.sh

(or 'autoreconf -vi')

To compile PVM, run:
	./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	make
	make install

To install PVM to a specific directory, so you can package it:
	make DESTDIR=/path/to/dir install

The build system installs a generic 'service' script in /etc/init.d
that will automatically start it on each boot. Take that into account
if already using the gvfs volume monitor.. it might cause glib/gio errors.


DEBIAN/UBUNTU
=============

Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives come with a modified glib, you have to
recompile and reinstall the same glib version for PVM to work.


LIBUDEV
=======

It's advised to use eudev or a pre-systemd udev (for old systems).
